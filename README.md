# Semantic Segmentation with Segformer

Semantic segmentation is a computer vision task that involves classifying each pixel in an image into a specific category. This repository contains code for performing semantic segmentation using the Segformer model, a transformer-based architecture designed for image segmentation tasks.

## Introduction

This project utilizes the Hugging Face Transformers library and Segformer pre-trained models to perform semantic segmentation on images. Semantic segmentation can be used in various applications, including object recognition, autonomous driving, and medical image analysis.

## Features

- Semantic segmentation using Segformer models.
- Integration with the Hugging Face Transformers library.
- Easy-to-use Python API for image segmentation tasks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package manager)
- GPU with CUDA support (recommended for faster inference)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/semantic-segmentation.git
   cd semantic-segmentation
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download pre-trained Segformer model weights from Hugging Face (if needed):

   ```bash
   python download_model.py
   ```

## Usage

To perform semantic segmentation on an image, you can use the provided `segment_image.py` script. Here's how to use it:

```bash
python segment_image.py --image_path path/to/your/image.jpg --output_path path/to/output/mask.png
```

This will generate a segmentation mask and save it as a PNG file.

## Custom Segmentation

If you want to perform semantic segmentation with custom Segformer models or train your own models, you can refer to the code in this repository as a starting point. Make sure to explore the Segformer documentation and Hugging Face Transformers documentation for more details on customizing and training models.
